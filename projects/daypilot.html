    <section>
      <h2>💡 The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Most productivity tools focus on either task management or calendar planning — rarely both.
        Users needed an intelligent, all-in-one app that helps them organize their day, prioritize tasks,
        discover events, and plan effectively.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Solution -->

      <h2>🛠️ The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        BenCode Studio designed and developed <strong>DayPilot</strong>, a cross-platform personal planner app
        that combines task tracking, event discovery, and AI-assisted scheduling into one elegant interface.
        Users can create tasks with priority, add events with time/location, get smart time suggestions, and
        discover nearby events — all in a seamless experience.
      </p>
      <ul>
